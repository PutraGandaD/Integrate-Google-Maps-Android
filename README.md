## Changelog
v0.1
- [x] Using Google Maps API Key for utilizing Google Maps basic features
- [x] Using ArrayList with Data Class for storing latitude, longitude, place name, place address
- [x] Using Fragment for Displaying Maps for better flexibility in most use cases (example: having navbar with multiple menu)
- [x] Added simple animations for zoom in when fragment/activity launched

v0.2
- [x] Added BottomSheetDialog for displaying marker's info (title, snippet, latitude, longitude, and Google Maps Intent button)
- [x] Added Google Maps Intent for redirecting to Google Maps using marker's latitude and longitude value 

## WORK IN PROGRESS
1. Getting current locations from user
2. Custom marker icon
3. Custom infowindow (tried for over 2 hours , and after reading Google official Docs, it's very hard)

## How to Use
Place your own Google Maps API Key into local.properties under Gradle Scripts, in MAPS_API_KEY
